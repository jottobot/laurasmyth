# laurasmyth

I would like a bio, a teaching/artist/diversity statement, my CV, my choreography portfolio, my performance portfolio, contact

I would like an image per page in the sense that it would either sit as background or in compliment to text. (perhaps 5 images) For choreography I will have several videos and for my own dancing I will try and edit my concert and commercial reel. 

I am not a fan of orange, red, yellow or blue. I love purples, brown, grey scales, burgundy, mossy green/sage green.

I like clean designs for websites but with small elements of artistry. I want it to feel like I am an artist and not a business woman.
